The basics of display the terminal information on the screen is:

  Console -> Terminal -> Screen

Where the `Console` connects to a PTY, the `Terminal` arranges the text on
the screen (advancing lines, etc) and `Screen` puts on the screen, using the
old fonts, to the user.

Vintage Terminal has the following classes:

Options........... Setup the options, read the arguments and the config file
Font.............. Load font, resizing it
Chars............. Setup the characters with attributes, and apply the filters
Console........... Connect to the PTY
Terminal.......... Format the characters on the terminal
Screen............ Display everything to the user
Filter............ Each one of the filters that'll be applied to the image
  FilterBright
  FilterInexact
  FilterScanline

When checking for memory leaks, use valgrind with the suppresions file 
vinterm.supp. That'll hide X11, SDL and forkpty memory leaks.
