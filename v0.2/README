Vintage Terminal
----------------

Use a terminal in style, like in the good old days! Vintage Terminal is a 
terminal emulator that simulates the looks of a 1980s monitor.

Vintage Terminal has the following features:

  * Partial VT100 support implemented, enough to run alpine, vim (with syntax 
    highlighting) and nethack and use commands like clear, man, more and less;
    - It won't yet run nano, mc or elinks.
  * Scaling (zoom) with the argument `-s`;
  * Has a authentic old look based on a IBM 5151 monitor.

This is a very early alpha release, so is not yet for the faint of heart. USE
AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Vintage Terminal requires the SDL library. <http://www.libsdl.org/>

The following features are planned:

  * Unicode support
  * Complete VT100 terminal support
  * Mouse support
  * Different colors for the monochrome monitor (ambar, blue, gray...)
  * Different types of old monitors (DEC terminals, TV...)
  * Ability to configure every aspect of the image
  * Full screen
  * MS-DOS console emulation for Windows

`Vintage Terminal` has only been tested on Linux so far.
