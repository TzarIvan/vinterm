Installation Instructions
-------------------------

The same as usual:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ su -
  # make install


Configure has the following extra options, which are only useful for developers:

  --enable-debug            Enable debugging information
  --enable-duma             Activate DUMA support (to check for memory errors)
